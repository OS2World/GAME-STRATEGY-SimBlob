|  SimBlob is a game under development by Amit Patel in his spare time.   |

|  This demo is not intended to be fully `playable' but you may find it   |
|  enjoyable anyway.                                                      |

|                                                                         |
| NOTE:                                                                   |
|  By default, SimBlob uses GpiDrawBits to draw to the screen.  This      |
|  drawing routine does not work on all systems (notably with ATI video   |
|  drivers), so you may need to use an alternate drawing method.  The     |
|  alternate drawing methods are selected with a command line parameter:  |
|                                                                         |
|  SIMBLOB ALTBITMAP                                                      |
|        uses WinDrawBitmap, which is slower but works on most (all?)     |
|        video drivers                                                    |
|  SIMBLOB DIVE                                                           |
|        uses DIVE, which is sometimes faster but sometimes slower,       |
|        because DIVE always draws the entire window to the screen,       |
|        even if only a tiny part needs to be drawn                       |
|  SIMBLOB HYBRID                                                         |
|        uses a hybrid of DIVE and GpiDrawBits.  Each time something      |
|        needs to be drawn, SimBlob will try to determine which method    |
|        is faster, and use that.  Small areas are generally drawn with   |
|        PM and large areas are generally drawn with DIVE.                |
|                                                                         |
|        Unfortunately, this method may not work well if you are using    |
|        16-bit color.  I have not tried it with 24-bit color yet.        |

| I am using Hershey fonts.  The Hershey Fonts were originally created    |
| by Dr. A. V. Hershey while working at the U. S. National Bureau of      |
| Standards, and they are free for use in commercial products, as long    |
| as they are not converted into the U.S. NTIS's font format.             |
|                                                                         |
