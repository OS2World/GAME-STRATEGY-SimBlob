<h1>What's New with SimBlob</h1>
<h3> 4 September 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Began implementing the lumber/logging industry.  This implementation
can be extended to firefighting and building, so I plan to remove the
old firefighting and building code and replace it with a single blob
scheduler that can handle lumberjacks, firefighters, and builders.
The new implementation should be smaller <EM>and</EM> faster.


</UL><P>
<h3> 3 September 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Worked out details of the lumber/logging industry.


</UL><P>
<h3> 19 August 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Improved the terrain generation algorithms.  There should no longer
be obvious vertical and horizontal lines on the initial map.


  <LI> Changed the firefighter routines to disable themselves when there are
no fires around.  This speeds up the game by 10 to 15 percent (when
there are no fires on the map).


</UL><P>
<h3> 18 August 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Found and (hopefully) fixed a bug that caused blobs to walk in weird
paths when their destination was blocked.


</UL><P>
<h3> 17 August 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Designed parts of the lumber/logging industry for BlobCity.  Forests
will be needed to build and sustain a city, so the player will have to
conserve some forests to survive.


</UL><P>
<h3> 15 August 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) Cleaned up and removed old code that was not being used.


</UL><P>
<h3> 7 August 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) Cleaned up a lot of code internally and added more checking to help
me find any memory errors.
