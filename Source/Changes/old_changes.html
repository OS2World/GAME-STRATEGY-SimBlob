<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> There is now an information area above the main map area.  The
information area will be used to display detailed information such as
employment, maintenance costs, income, and food production.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The money display, population display, and speed display are now
buttons that control what is displayed in the information area.
Clicking on the money button leads to the Financial Page, which will
eventually show income, maintenance, and spending.  Clicking on the
population button leads to the Census Page, which shows employment,
jobs, food production, food consumed, and a few other things.
Clicking on the speed button leads to the Speed Page, which shows
information about how quickly the display is being updated.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The status bar now has two sections: the left section shows the
currently selected tool; the right section shows either help about the
current tool or information about what is underneath the mouse
pointer.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" colspan=2 align=center><font size="+2"> 22 April 1998 </font></td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> I experimented with overlaying information about employment,
population, and so on, over the map but having information that
doesn't scroll when the map causes some design problems, and it leads
to slower screen drawing, so I took it out.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" colspan=2 align=center><font size="+2"> 11 April 1998 </font></td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The Population display is now a button; clicking on it cycles through
Population, Jobs, and Food Production.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The speed display is also a button; clicking on it cycles through
Ticks/Sec., Frames/Sec., and Pixels/Sec.  Ticks are a measure of
internal simulation speed (water flow, blob movement, and so on).
Frames are a measure of how often the window is being updated.  Pixels
measure how much of the window is being updated.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Fixed mouse movement code so that if a button is highlighted and you
move outside the window, it catches it and unhighlights the button.
(This may not work in OS/2 Warp 3 without FP 17 or higher.)

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 4:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> I still plan to change the user interface more, but I need to write

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Changed the location of information (population display, silver, and
so on.)  to work better when the window is smaller.  There is now a
bar at the top of the map window that shows silver and population.
This allows the left information panel to be smaller, and information
won't be cut off if the window is at the default size.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Moved the Tool help from just above the world map to the status bar;
moved the date to just below "BlobCity" on the information panel.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The current (game) year is now displayed along with the date.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 4:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Experimented with putting the horizontal scrollbar at the top; it's
just too weird.

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Fixed a bug with mouse movement outside the window resulting in the
cursor appearing in the lower left corner.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:<br><font size=-2>(Internal)</font></td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top>  Fixed a potential bug that could result if altitudes got
out of range.

<tr><td align=right valign=top bgcolor="#fefeee">&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff"> 
I tried upgrading my machine from a Pentium/133 to Pentium/200 but there

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" colspan=2 align=center><font size="+2"> 3 March 1998 </font></td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> SimBlob now installs two-color mouse pointers for use in the map
window.  Two color pointers usually reduce or eliminate pointer
flicker.  The mouse pointer may change depending on the tool being
used.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The scale of the map has been changed.  The highest mountains are now
750 feet higher than the lowest valleys.  Walls are 120 feet high.
Trenches are 50 feet deep.  The terrain is simulated down to the
nearest six feet, but water is simulated down to the nearest inch.  It
is possible that I will change terrain simulation to work down to the
nearest foot.

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Added a new tool, called the <EM>Select Tool</EM>.  This tool allows
you to point to an object on the screen and find out what it is.
Later, it will allow you to click on an object to learn about its
details.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" colspan=2 align=center><font size="+2"> 27 February 1998 </font></td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Reduced the executable size significantly by moving some data to
external files and moving other data from compile time initialization
to run time initialization.  Two weeks ago the executable was 400k,
and now it is 220k.

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Improved map creation.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Removed the splash screen bitmap, since it was taking up 25% of the
ZIP file and 40% of the EXE file.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:<br><font size=-2>(Internal)</font></td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top>  Fixed a bug with dragging the mouse to draw something.

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Improved path-finding so that blobs who need to walk a long distance
can search part of the path, walk that part, and then search the rest
of the path.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Greatly improved the path-finder speed when the Path setting is "Fast".

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> To learn more about economics for The Silver Kingdoms, I have been
reading many books about both economics and biology, including books
by Rothschild, Gould, and Kauffman.  With each book I was excited with
the ideas at first, but I came away with nothing really compelling.  I
am now reading some papers by <A
HREF="http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/">Paul Krugman</A>, who
criticizes the authors I was reading previously for having too many
ideas and not enough substance.  Krugman, unlike the other authors,
seems convincing, although each of the other authors seemed convincing
at first.  (I have the feeling that he is different, though.)  In a
month or so, I hope to have a good economic model for The Silver
Kingdoms.  I also plan to read about geography and history of cities
to get more background material for the game.  Krugman has done some
work on combining economics and geography, and I hope that will be
useful for me to make city placement an important part of The Silver
Kingdoms.

The mouse cursor follows the pointer much more closely now.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> When using the blob tool, blobs won't be created until there are no
blobs in the starting position (marked by a big 'B'), because only one
blob should be in any hex at one time.  The blobs will wait to be
created until there are no blobs in that position.

</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Fixed a MAJOR bug with path-finding.  Thanks go again to Tels,
although this time instead of finding the problem he questioned part
of my code, which turned out to be incorrect.  Path-finding appears to
be working perfectly now, for the first time.  (Unfortunately, it's
not working well for longer paths.)

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> There is a new hybrid drawing mode that uses DIVE and slow PM.
(Previously, the hybrid mode was DIVE and fast PM.)  DIVE support is
still experimental, and the hybrid modes are even more experimental,
so use at your own risk!

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> You can now control separately what kind of drawing is used for the
controls around the window (left panel, world map, and status bar) and
the main map.  The first argument to SimBlob tells it what to use for
the main map, and can be FASTGPI, SLOWGPI, FASTHYBRID, SLOWHYBRID, or
DIVE.  The "Fast" versions use GpiDrawBits, which is fairly fast, but
isn't supported in a few video drivers.  The second argument tells
SimBlob what to use for the controls, and can have any of the five
values listed above.  The default is FAST for both.

<P>It is <EM>not</EM> recommended that you use DIVE or the HYBRID
options for the controls.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The InitMap.txt commands have changed, so take a look at

suggested by Tels (author of G.W.A.N.).

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The path finding code uses an adaptive cutoff instead of a static
cutoff.  The cutoff determines when the path finder gives up and
returns a partial path.  The cutoff is now determined based on the
length of the path needed and the number of times the blob has been
trying to find a path to the goal.  As the distance to the goal
increases, the cutoff increases.  Also, the more times the blob tries
to find a path, the longer the path finder will search.  (In some ways
this is like Iterative Deepening A*, in that it will only try so far
but if it fails, it will try again, going deeper into the search.)

</td></tr>

and west.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The map creation system is now controlled through a file called
InitMap.txt.  You can edit this file to change which algorithms are
used to generate a map, and in which order they are applied.  With
this file you can choose whether you want good maps (which take a
while to generate) or fast maps.  The algorithms available and their
names are likely to change soon though, so if you make a custom setup,
check the InitMap.txt that comes with the game each time you download
a new version.

<P> SimBlob will look both in the SimBlob directory and the Data/
subdirectory for InitMap.txt.  I recommend copying the file from the
Data directory into the main SimBlob directory, and editing it there.

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The blob scheduler has been disabled, and instead blobs just pick for
themselves which task to perform next.  (The two were conflicting.)
The goal is to have the blob scheduler assign tasks, and only if it
doesn't give orders, then do the blobs choose for themselves.  This is
based on biology: muscles and nerves can act by themselves, unless
supressed by higher level orders from the brain.  This is why chickens
keep running around after their heads are cut off.  <CODE>:)</CODE>
Here, blobs should be able to continue functioning even if the main
task scheduler has no orders for them.  However, I need to think some
more about how the scheduler should work.

Please be careful when comparing different drawing techniques
(such as PM vs. DIVE).  To redraw a small part of the window with
DIVE, the entire window must be redrawn.  Non-DIVE drawing can
draw only the area that needs to be drawn.  As a result, when using
DIVE, the MPixels per second number will be higher, because more 
pixels have to be drawn to the window.  However, since many redraws
don't have to draw all the pixels, PM drawing can be faster.  The
frames per second code is a better indicator of drawing speed, but
it is hard to use that as a comparison, because the number will vary
depending on what is being drawn and what part of the map you are
viewing.  For example, if the window is over an empty area of the map,
few pixels need to be drawn so PM gets a high frames per second value.
Also it's hard to tell what is going on with graphics speed because 
SimBlob uses so much CPU time for simulation code.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:<br><font size=-2>(Internal)</font></td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top>  I have designed and partially implemented a new display
system.  Previously, I was using hexagons to determine which parts of
the screen needed to be redrawn.  Each hexagon was marked 'clean' or
'dirty', and all the dirty hexagons were drawn.  The problem with this
approach is that some of the overlays (such as blobs) are not
hexagons; I was handling that by marking the hexagons near and under
the blob as dirty.  Some of you may have seen the bridge drawing
problem, where water would show up through bridges.  This was also an
artifact of the dirty hexagon system.<P>

The new system is structured instead as a set of rectangles
(<code>HRGN</code> for OS/2 programmers).  Also, there are multiple
layers of overlays instead of all the drawing code being in one huge
routine.  The map is drawn at the bottom, then water, then bridges,
then blobs, and finally any textual messages. <P>

The advantages over the old system are:
<OL>
  <LI> Smaller pieces of code are more easily maintained.
  <LI> It should be possible to turn layers on and off
       individually.
  <LI> Oddly shaped items such as bridges can be drawn correctly.
  <LI> Transparency is handled correctly.  Previously, it
       was possible for a transparent bitmap to be drawn twice
       in the same place, so that it showed up opaque.  The
       old solution is to force a much larger redraw
       than necessary, but the new system can handle transparency
       so it won't be necessary to draw so much.
  <LI> I will be able to handle overlay text properly.  (In
       the old system, anything that was larger than a hexagon
	      could not be drawn reliably.)
  <LI> I can place user-interface gadgets on the map as well, 
       like buttons or menus.  Since I can do this, I will
	      change the status area on the left and the status bar on
	      the bottom to use this system as well.
</OL>

The new system also includes:
<OL>
  <LI> "Picking" (which I had implemented as a separate module
       and then lost)
  <LI> Support for non-map layers for user-interface controls
  <LI> Irregularly shaped user-interface controls

     <UL>
 <li> The main window is laid out "automatically" using
      Layout algorithms.  The layout objects can set up
      components Horizontally or Vertically, and a component
      can be another Layout, a fixed space, a variable space,
      or a window (or control). <P> Now I don't have to 
      compute the coordinates of each of the controls, so
      it's very easy to add new ones.
 <li> The scrollbars are now part of the main window instead
      of part of the frame window.  OS/2's frame window has
      flags to create two scrollbars, but I wanted four, and
      I also wanted to control their size and placement.
 <li> The statusbar uses the "Subject-Observer" design
      pattern [also called Model-View-Controller] instead
      of the more traditional object interface.  <P>

      This is very helpful because various parts of the
      program only have to know about Subjects -- they don't
      have to be aware of where the subject data will be
      displayed (a statusbar), so I can move the display to
      another control (like a static text control or titlebar)
      without requiring any changes in all the clients.  Also,
      since StatusBar relies on PM, this will allow me to write
      modules are <B>not</B> dependent on PM in any way.
 <li> I'm going to make the scrollbars use Subject-Observer
      so that the view window, the keyboard interface, and
      the scrollbar all look at a common (consistent) map
      position, instead of all three trying to update each
	     other to maintain consistency manually.  Subject-Observer
      requires less code and is more flexible than the
	     traditional object interfaces.  I should write a web
      page about SimBlob's internals sometime, but things
      are changing so fast right now that I think I will wait
	     until the internals stabilize.

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 9:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> If you resize the window large enough, the scrollbars <em>should</em>
disappear.  This is flaky right now -- sometimes they don't disappear,
and sometimes they disappear and won't come back.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> You can now build residential areas.  Up to 7 homes can be
in each hex.  People will move in automatically, and the
gray (empty) homes will turn into red (full) ones.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:<br><font size=-2>(Internal)</font></td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top>  Some of the redrawing code has been rewritten.  If you see any
redraw problems, please let me know!  Bright purple is my error
color -- if you see it, you know there's a problem.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 4:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The map initialization is done in a separate thread instead of
in the main one.  The window will come up faster now, but it
still takes a while before the map appears.

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The game is much faster!  I restructured the redrawing code, and
it got much faster, but it still needs some redraw bugs fixed.

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> <A NAME="layered"><strong>Layered Terrain</strong></A>: 
There are three levels of tiles
instead of just one.  The bottom layer is the altitude indicator:<br>
<IMG SRC="hex2grass.gif" ALT="[wet grass]">
<IMG SRC="hex1grass.gif" ALT="[dry grass]">
<IMG SRC="hexdirt.gif" ALT="[clear area]">
<IMG SRC="hex1hill.gif" ALT="[low hill]">
<IMG SRC="hex2hill.gif" ALT="[high hill]">
<IMG SRC="hex1mountain.gif" ALT="[low mountain]">
<IMG SRC="hex2mountain.gif" ALT="[high mountain]">
<br>
The middle layer has structures:<br>
<IMG SRC="hexfarm.gif" ALT="">farm,
<IMG SRC="hexroad.gif" ALT="">road, and
<IMG SRC="hexwall.gif" ALT="">wall.
<br>
The top layer has water:<br>
<IMG SRC="hexwater.gif" ALT="[water]">
<br>
The main effect of this is that you can now have multiple things
on a single tile.  Previously, if there was a wall, the grass
would not be displayed, and only a wall on a gray tile.  Now the
wall is shown on top of grass.  If there is water, you can partially
see what's underneath.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Farms will automatically spring up around roads.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Farms are destroyed by water.  (They're not Rice Farms.)

</td></tr>

There are ways to manipulate it.  :)

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> There are now different colored tiles for different altitudes:
green is low; brown is medium; gray is high.

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The terrain is now a bowl-shape instead of an inclined plane.  This
causes the water to flow into the middle.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Simple erosion is implemented.  Sediments will flow along with the
water.  To see the effect of this, just start the program and let
it run for a while.  The lake starts to fill up with dirt, and it
gets wider.  Or is the effect of having more water?  :)  I don't know!
Another way to see this is to force the river into some path, and
later take away the walls.  Some of the time you will see that the
river has eroded away a path for itself and it will not return to
its original path.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Walls are 100 inches high instead of 1000 inches.  This makes overflows
much more likely.

<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 1:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> There are now scrollbars that seem to work.  The display is
a little bit slow; I am working on speeding this up.
(Note:  The pageup/pagedown and lineup/linedown parts don't
 work yet, but you should be able to drag the scrollbutton
 around.)

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 2:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The game is running a little slower than it should because
the entire map is drawn instead of just the part that's visible.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 3:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The menu has a "Color Edit" option that brings up a color palette.
You can drag a color from the palette to the game to change the
color of the standard controls (titlebar (active & inactive), 
menu, system menu, scrollbar, and frame (active & inactive)).

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 4:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> Use the left mouse button to toggle the terrain in one direction
and the right mouse button to go in the other direction.  This won't
be there for long, because the right button will be used to bring up
a context-sensitive menu for the object(s) under the mouse.  The most
likely interface will be the user selecting a tool (road, wall, farm,
etc.) and then selecting areas to build the item.

</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#fefeee" valign=top align=right> 5:</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top> The window can be resized and things <em>should</em> look right.
