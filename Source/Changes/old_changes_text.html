<h1>List of Older Changes</h1>
<h3> 23 April 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> There is now an information area above the main map area.  The
information area will be used to display detailed information such as
employment, maintenance costs, income, and food production.


  <LI> The money display, population display, and speed display are now
buttons that control what is displayed in the information area.
Clicking on the money button leads to the Financial Page, which will
eventually show income, maintenance, and spending.  Clicking on the
population button leads to the Census Page, which shows employment,
jobs, food production, food consumed, and a few other things.
Clicking on the speed button leads to the Speed Page, which shows
information about how quickly the display is being updated.


  <LI> The status bar now has two sections: the left section shows the
currently selected tool; the right section shows either help about the
current tool or information about what is underneath the mouse
pointer.


</UL><P>
<h3> 22 April 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> I experimented with overlaying information about employment,
population, and so on, over the map but having information that
doesn't scroll when the map causes some design problems, and it leads
to slower screen drawing, so I took it out.


</UL><P>
<h3> 11 April 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The Population display is now a button; clicking on it cycles through
Population, Jobs, and Food Production.


  <LI> The speed display is also a button; clicking on it cycles through
Ticks/Sec., Frames/Sec., and Pixels/Sec.  Ticks are a measure of
internal simulation speed (water flow, blob movement, and so on).
Frames are a measure of how often the window is being updated.  Pixels
measure how much of the window is being updated.


  <LI> Fixed mouse movement code so that if a button is highlighted and you
move outside the window, it catches it and unhighlights the button.
(This may not work in OS/2 Warp 3 without FP 17 or higher.)


  <LI> I still plan to change the user interface more, but I need to write
some more code first.


</UL><P>
<h3> 10 April 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Changed the location of information (population display, silver, and
so on.)  to work better when the window is smaller.  There is now a
bar at the top of the map window that shows silver and population.
This allows the left information panel to be smaller, and information
won't be cut off if the window is at the default size.


  <LI> Moved the Tool help from just above the world map to the status bar;
moved the date to just below "BlobCity" on the information panel.


  <LI> The current (game) year is now displayed along with the date.


  <LI> Experimented with putting the horizontal scrollbar at the top; it's
just too weird.


</UL><P>
<h3> 9 April 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Removed the help in BlobCity, because it was leading to system instability.


</UL><P>
<h3> 22 March 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Added a small amount of help to BlobCity.


</UL><P>
<h3> 21 March 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Implemented a very basic prototype of The Silver Kingdoms economics.


</UL><P>
<h3> 20 March 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Worked on a design of basic economic formulas for The Silver Kingdoms.


</UL><P>
<h3> 16 March 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Fixed a bug with mouse movement outside the window resulting in the
cursor appearing in the lower left corner.


  <LI> (Internal) Fixed a potential bug that could result if altitudes got
out of range.


</UL><P>
<h3> 8 March 1998 </h3>

I tried upgrading my machine from a Pentium/133 to Pentium/200 but there
have been some problems with instability, so I haven't worked on SimBlob
lately.


<UL>
</UL><P>
<h3> 4 March 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Changed the flow through gates to one foot of water per tick.


</UL><P>
<h3> 3 March 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> SimBlob now installs two-color mouse pointers for use in the map
window.  Two color pointers usually reduce or eliminate pointer
flicker.  The mouse pointer may change depending on the tool being
used.


  <LI> The scale of the map has been changed.  The highest mountains are now
750 feet higher than the lowest valleys.  Walls are 120 feet high.
Trenches are 50 feet deep.  The terrain is simulated down to the
nearest six feet, but water is simulated down to the nearest inch.  It
is possible that I will change terrain simulation to work down to the
nearest foot.


</UL><P>
<h3> 2 March 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) Fixed bugs in the selection tool.


</UL><P>
<h3> 1 March 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Added a new tool, called the <EM>Select Tool</EM>.  This tool allows
you to point to an object on the screen and find out what it is.
Later, it will allow you to click on an object to learn about its
details.


</UL><P>
<h3> 27 February 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Reduced the executable size significantly by moving some data to
external files and moving other data from compile time initialization
to run time initialization.  Two weeks ago the executable was 400k,
and now it is 220k.


</UL><P>
<h3> 26 February 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Increased the water flow rate to make water flow look better.


</UL><P>
<h3> 22 February 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) Created a train object that can move around.


</UL><P>
<h3> 21 February 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Worked out train physics for acceleration, deceleration, movement on
hills, and so on.


  <LI> Worked out train display formulas.


</UL><P>
<h3> 20 February 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Added train graphics, for future use by a train/transport moving
around the map.


</UL><P>
<h3> 15 February 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Improved map creation.


  <LI> Removed the splash screen bitmap, since it was taking up 25% of the
ZIP file and 40% of the EXE file.


  <LI> (Internal) Fixed a bug with dragging the mouse to draw something.


</UL><P>
<h3> 24 January 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Improved path-finding so that blobs who need to walk a long distance
can search part of the path, walk that part, and then search the rest
of the path.


  <LI> Greatly improved the path-finder speed when the Path setting is "Fast".


  <LI> To learn more about economics for The Silver Kingdoms, I have been
reading many books about both economics and biology, including books
by Rothschild, Gould, and Kauffman.  With each book I was excited with
the ideas at first, but I came away with nothing really compelling.  I
am now reading some papers by <A
HREF="http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/">Paul Krugman</A>, who
criticizes the authors I was reading previously for having too many
ideas and not enough substance.  Krugman, unlike the other authors,
seems convincing, although each of the other authors seemed convincing
at first.  (I have the feeling that he is different, though.)  In a
month or so, I hope to have a good economic model for The Silver
Kingdoms.  I also plan to read about geography and history of cities
to get more background material for the game.  Krugman has done some
work on combining economics and geography, and I hope that will be
useful for me to make city placement an important part of The Silver
Kingdoms.


</UL><P>
<h3> 23 January 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) Worked on path-finding improvements.


</UL><P>
<h3> 20 January 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Reimplemented major speed improvements with non-DIVE drawing code.
The mouse cursor follows the pointer much more closely now.


  <LI> When using the blob tool, blobs won't be created until there are no
blobs in the starting position (marked by a big 'B'), because only one
blob should be in any hex at one time.  The blobs will wait to be
created until there are no blobs in that position.


  <LI> Optimizations with map traversal and blob movement have boosted the
simulation speed by up to 30%.


  <LI> Fixed a memory leak with auto-build mode and blobs.


</UL><P>
<h3> 19 January 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Fixed a MAJOR bug with path-finding.  Thanks go again to Tels,
although this time instead of finding the problem he questioned part
of my code, which turned out to be incorrect.  Path-finding appears to
be working perfectly now, for the first time.  (Unfortunately, it's
not working well for longer paths.)


  <LI> Fixed some minor problems with the uneven distribution of trees and
volcanos.


  <LI> Volcanos work better now, with lava flowing downhill just like water does.


  <LI> You are not charged for building something until the blobs actually
build it.  Previously, you were charged when you asked for something
to be built.


</UL><P>
<h3> 17 January 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The path-finding code is slightly faster, thanks to Tels (author of G.W.A.N.).


  <LI> A bug with houses and farms being built on top of roads was fixed.


</UL><P>
<h3> 12 January 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> A new Deity menu option, "Flash Flood", will make rivers rise and
possibly go over their banks.


</UL><P>
<h3> 8 January 1998 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> I just got Civilization II.  Don't expect any changes to SimBlob for
a while ..



</UL><P>
<h3> 28 December 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The world map is much more responsive when you try dragging the mouse around.


  <LI> The world map now shows the location of blobs.


</UL><P>
<h3> 25 December 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> There is a new hybrid drawing mode that uses DIVE and slow PM.
(Previously, the hybrid mode was DIVE and fast PM.)  DIVE support is
still experimental, and the hybrid modes are even more experimental,
so use at your own risk!


  <LI> You can now control separately what kind of drawing is used for the
controls around the window (left panel, world map, and status bar) and
the main map.  The first argument to SimBlob tells it what to use for
the main map, and can be FASTGPI, SLOWGPI, FASTHYBRID, SLOWHYBRID, or
DIVE.  The "Fast" versions use GpiDrawBits, which is fairly fast, but
isn't supported in a few video drivers.  The second argument tells
SimBlob what to use for the controls, and can have any of the five
values listed above.  The default is FAST for both.

<P>It is <EM>not</EM> recommended that you use DIVE or the HYBRID
options for the controls.


  <LI> The InitMap.txt commands have changed, so take a look at
Data/InitMap.txt again if you are using a custom InitMap.txt.


</UL><P>
<h3> 24 December 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The path-finding works somewhat better now.


  <LI> Blobs can now climb over walls, but it takes some time.


  <LI> Blobs can now build and erase walls.


  <LI> Idle blobs will move around randomly now.


  <LI> If a blob realizes that some other blob has already performed its
job, then it will stop and do something else.


</UL><P>
<h3> 23 December 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Christmas Graphics add-on, with Santa Blobs (carrying candy canes and
wearing Santa hats) and Christmas Trees was released.


</UL><P>
<h3> 22 December 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The menus have been rearranged to group all the "Simulation" and all
the "View" options together.  (The difference being that in the future
there may be more than one "View" but only one "Simulation".)


</UL><P>
<h3> 21 December 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The path finding code is somewhat faster, thanks to optimizations
suggested by Tels (author of G.W.A.N.).


  <LI> The path finding code uses an adaptive cutoff instead of a static
cutoff.  The cutoff determines when the path finder gives up and
returns a partial path.  The cutoff is now determined based on the
length of the path needed and the number of times the blob has been
trying to find a path to the goal.  As the distance to the goal
increases, the cutoff increases.  Also, the more times the blob tries
to find a path, the longer the path finder will search.  (In some ways
this is like Iterative Deepening A*, in that it will only try so far
but if it fails, it will try again, going deeper into the search.)


  <LI> Occasionally, water wouldn't flow out of a spring because the spring
was too low in a valley.  This bug was fixed.


</UL><P>
<h3> 20 December 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Fixed a bug with water tending to go north and east more than south
and west.


  <LI> The map creation system is now controlled through a file called
InitMap.txt.  You can edit this file to change which algorithms are
used to generate a map, and in which order they are applied.  With
this file you can choose whether you want good maps (which take a
while to generate) or fast maps.  The algorithms available and their
names are likely to change soon though, so if you make a custom setup,
check the InitMap.txt that comes with the game each time you download
a new version.

<P> SimBlob will look both in the SimBlob directory and the Data/
subdirectory for InitMap.txt.  I recommend copying the file from the
Data directory into the main SimBlob directory, and editing it there.


</UL><P>
<h3> 18 December 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Fixed a bug with blobs that may occur after running the game for
several hours.


  <LI> When a blob is idle, he will look around for nearby jobs first, so
that he won't have to walk far.


  <LI> The blob scheduler has been disabled, and instead blobs just pick for
themselves which task to perform next.  (The two were conflicting.)
The goal is to have the blob scheduler assign tasks, and only if it
doesn't give orders, then do the blobs choose for themselves.  This is
based on biology: muscles and nerves can act by themselves, unless
supressed by higher level orders from the brain.  This is why chickens
keep running around after their heads are cut off.  <CODE>:)</CODE>
Here, blobs should be able to continue functioning even if the main
task scheduler has no orders for them.  However, I need to think some
more about how the scheduler should work.


</UL><P>
<h3> 17 December 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> If a new building order comes in that is in the same location as an
existing order, it replaces it so that a blob won't waste its time
working on something that's going to be replaced.


  <LI> Blobs will pick the nearest job assigned to them instead of picking
the first one on their list.


  <LI> Blobs should no longer get stuck trying to get past another blob.


  <LI> A hexagon is drawn around a hex that is waiting for a blob to work
there.  It is bluish green if a blob has been assigned to work there,
and dark gray otherwise.


</UL><P>
<h3> 16 December 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) I've finished reimplementing the way blobs build things.


  <LI> Up to six blob builders can be around at any one time.  


  <LI> Jobs will be assigned to the blob builder closest to them, but this
"greedy" algorithm isn't an ideal way to schedule blobs.  It is,
however, better than the previous algorithm, in that a blob will try
to take several related jobs at once.


  <LI> Blobs do not build walls or set fires.  (This will take some more work.)


  <LI> (Internal) Several bugs involving blob creation and movement have been fixed.


</UL><P>
<h3> 30 November 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) I've written some general guidelines for myself for using
data without thread locking.  I'm adapting the implementation of blob
storage to follow these guidelines.  It's a little bit less
restrictive than my previous guidelines, so the way blobs are stored
can be more flexible.


</UL><P>
<h3> 26 November 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Blobs can now accept up to six tasks instead of one.  This way they
won't sit idle after finishing one; they will know where to go next
without waiting for new orders.


</UL><P>
<h3> 22 November 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) The way the blobs are stored is being redone to reduce the
amount of thread locking needed, and also to support a new version of
blob task assignment.


</UL><P>
<h3> 16 November 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Instead of sending a lot of blobs to build something, a few are sent, and
they receive new orders after completing each task.  (Blobs are reused.)


</UL><P>
<h3> 15 November 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) The simulation thread has a command queue that stores
commands that have not yet been executed.


  <LI> When you draw with the mouse, the effects are not seen immediately.
Instead, they are fed into the command queue, and the building is
handled at the rate of one hex per tick.


  <LI> Blobs are sent to build the things you select with the mouse.


</UL><P>
<h3> 6 November 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The map is now larger.


</UL><P>
<h3> 5 November 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The altitude equalization routine has been modified so that it
produces more grasslands than mountains.


</UL><P>
<h3> 27 October 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The soil erosion algorithm was modified to do fewer hexes at a time, so
that you no longer see an abrupt erosion "jump" from time to time.


</UL><P>
<h3> 26 October 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The water erosion formulas were changed, hopefully so that rivers don't
mutate into lakes after ten million ticks.


</UL><P>
<h3> 12 October 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The font is slightly better.


  <LI> During initialization, the progress (as a percentage) is shown on the
status bar.  The progress is calculated dynamically based on the
initialization during the previous execution of SimBlob.  This way, it
is calibrated to your computer's behavior, and it is not reliant on
your computer being similar to mine.  (The data is stored in
Data/Progress.dat, for those of you who are curious.)


  <LI> The text in the world map window is more readable, thanks to a dark
background rectangle.


  <LI> If there is a cost to building an item, that cost is displayed along
with the name of the item under the tool area.


</UL><P>
<h3> 5 October 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The killing of threads when you exit the program during
initialization is improved.  For reference, the thread priorities are:
Main:Regular+0, Paint:Regular+0 (when the window is active),
Paint:Idle+6 (when the window is inactive), Initialization:Idle+31,
Simulation:Regular+0.  While exiting, the thread priorities are
increased to Regular+31 so that they can quickly finish whatever
they're doing, and exit.


  <LI> The main font is now Hershey-Plain 12.  The Hershey fonts are
basically free so I don't have to worry about licensing of fonts.


  <LI> The current tool is highlighted in red, instead of a gradient gray.
(The red is easier to see.)


  <LI> The textured background is gone; I'm experimenting with a cleaner,
simpler look.


  <LI> There is a new option to the Speed menu to control anti-aliased
drawing.  The default is on but you may want to experiment with
turning it off to see if it draws any faster.  Unfortunately at this
time, fonts look awful without anti-aliasing.


  <LI> The name of the current tool is displayed below the tool area.


</UL><P>
<h3> 19 September 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Blobs that came out of a watch tower will go back in if they have
nothing to do.


  <LI> Blobs that come out of a watch tower are worker blobs; blobs that you
create with the blob tool are soldier blobs.  For now, both fight
fires.


</UL><P>
<h3> 17 September 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The tool objects can take the Ctrl modifier into account.  Also, only
some tools default to line-drawing mode.


</UL><P>
<h3> 8 September 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) The logic for determining whether the current cursor is
valid has been moved into the tool objects.


  <LI> When using the Blob tool, the cursor is shown only when the pointer
is over a blob.


</UL><P>
<h3> 20 August 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) A "text style" class collects all the font style settings
in one place.


</UL><P>
<h3> 18 August 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The thread priority for the map creation have been adjusted to Idle +7.


</UL><P>
<h3> 30 July 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> BlobTool lets you send a firefighter blob to a particular location.


  <LI> The tool buttons have been rearranged because there are now ten
instead of eight.  The new buttons are the 'firefighter blob' button
and the 'fire' button.


  <LI> With the blob tool, you can tell a blob where to go.  Just drag the
blob to a new location, and it will walk there if it can find a way.
(Use the right mouse button to drag.)


</UL><P>
<h3> 29 July 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) BuildTool is a Tool object that is used for building.  The
current mouse behavior for the primary mouse button (click and drag to
build something) will be put into BuildTool.  Note: the build tool
doesn't yet handle Ctrl and Shift modifiers properly.


  <LI> Other tools that are being designed are the SelectTool, which is used
to select objects such as soldiers, farms, houses, and firefighters.
This tool will also be used to give orders to the blobs.  Another tool
is the BlobTool, which will let you send a blob to a particular
location.


</UL><P>
<h3> 26 July 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) A new Tool class replaces the one I lost a year ago.  It
is based on CUA actions like drag, context-menu, and open, instead of
physical mouse actions like right-drag, right-click, and
left-double-click.


</UL><P>
<h3> 21 July 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> SimBlob should now follow the Mouse Settings more closely.  For
example, if you change the mouse setting for "context menu" to
Shift-LeftClick, then SimBlob will use the new setting instead of the
default RightClick.  I'm not sure what happens when the settings
conflict.  For example, some people like to drag objects with the left
mouse, but left-drags are considered "swipes" (multiple object
selection).  Also, it is possible to set up the left mouse button to
bring up a context menu; should SimBlob consider left-click a draw
request or a context menu request?  At any rate, these concerns are
present in other applications as well, and SimBlob's behavior will be
consistent with them.


</UL><P>
<h3> 20 July 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) I'm now using Menu objects instead of handling menu
commands directly, with PM functions and message handlers.  The menu
objects have made menus easier to work with and more flexible at the
same time.  Also, the game is slightly smaller due to elimination of
repetitive code.


  <LI> (Internal) All the menu items that have checkmarks are now handled
with the "Subject-Observer" pattern.  This pattern lets me merely set
the variable and have the menu item automatically update itself.
Also, if one chooses the menu item, the variable automatically updates
itself.


  <LI> A new blitting mode (HYBRID) is available.  Each time something needs
to be drawn, hybrid mode will select DIVE or PM, depending on which
would be faster.  Unfortunately, DIVE and PM seem to treat bitmap
colors differently, at least in 16-bit color mode, so I'm getting 
some strange colors at times.


</UL><P>
<h3> 19 July 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) I've made it easier for me to use the "Subject-Observer"
design pattern.  The code has become slightly smaller, and I've
started using this pattern in more places.


</UL><P>
<h3> 18 July 1997 </h3>

I've been experimenting with the water simulation.


<UL>
  <LI> Water levels are now calculated in inches rather than feet.  This
gives the simulation more detail.


  <LI> Under 6 inches of water will not cause water damage to houses, farms,
or roads.


  <LI> Small pools of water will evaporate more quickly.


</UL><P>
<h3> 1 July 1997 </h3>

I've been playing <A HREF="http://www.stardock.com">Entrepreneur</A>
instead of working on SimBlob.


<UL>
</UL><P>
<h3> 7 June 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The firefighters can now detect fires in a larger area.


  <LI> Auto-build mode only extends roads; it does not create new ones.


  <LI> A new Debug menu allows you to view debugging information
graphically.  Preferences are white if blobs want to build a road, and
black if blobs want to build a farm or houses.  Labor is lighter if
there are a lot of workers travelling along the roads.  Heat is white
for hot areas (caused by fire); it is black for cold areas (caused by
extinguishing fire).  Food is lighter if a lot of food is being
transported along the roads.  Moisture is lighter if the area is near
moisture.


  <LI> After being able to visually see simulation variables, I was able to
fix several bugs, including ones in auto-build mode, in labor
calculations, in food distribution, in fire watchtowers, and in
moisture calculations.


</UL><P>
<h3> 11 May 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The fonts are nicer.


  <LI> The descenders on lowercase letters of fonts no longer get cut off.


  <LI> For now, firefighters will emerge from Watchtowers but they don't go
back in.


  <LI> When there is a fire on the map, the world map will display "Fire!"


</UL><P>
<h3> 10 May 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Watchtowers are buildings where firefighters watch for nearby fires.  If
there is a fire nearby, a firefighter will exit the building to go fight
the fire.


</UL><P>
<h3> 4 May 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The date that SimBlob was compiled is shown in the information area on the
top left.


</UL><P>
<h3> 3 May 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The drawing code was optimized.


  <LI> The experimental river basin algorithm was modified, but it still isn't
very good.


</UL><P>
<h3> 2 May 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The terrain generation was modified with an experimental river basin
generation algorithm.


</UL><P>
<h3> 26 April 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The mouse pointer changes to show you which tool is being used.


</UL><P>
<h3> 18 April 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> You can no longer erase fires.


  <LI> The cursor will disappear if you are not allowed to use the current
tool in the current location.  If you try an invalid drag operation,
it will draw red hexagons instead of the normal drag hexagons.


  <LI> There are no longer canals in the game.  Instead, there are
"trenches".  The difference is that a trench is not concrete-lined, so
there is a small possibility of erosion, and also that you can build
other things in a trench.  (For example, you may wish to build a gate
in the trench to control water flow, or build a bridge over the
trench.)  The "canal" button is still there, but it now creates trenches.


  <LI> To erase a trench, you must first erase whatever is built on/in them.


</UL><P>
<h3> 13 April 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> In DIVE mode, only the main map is drawn with DIVE.  (Previously, the
statusbar and other parts of the window were drawn with DIVE as well.)


  <LI> A bug was fixed with the cursor; it now follows the mouse much more
closely.


  <LI> (Internal) Buttons have been implemented with the new Glyphs.


  <LI> I'm now using new buttons for the toolbar.  Finally, just about all
the controls have been switched over to the new graphics format that
I introduced last year.


</UL><P>
<h3> 12 April 1997 </h3>


<UL>

you are holding shift at the beginning of the drag, not during the drag.

<h3> 30 March 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) I've again redesigned the Glyph system.  I found a flaw in
the previous design that was keeping me from the next step: the
ability to click or drag map objects.


  <LI> (Internal) I've rewritten large parts of the graphics system to use
the new Glyphs.  A side effect of this new design is that parts of SimBlob
have become simpler and smaller.


  <LI> SimBlob will remember the window position when you close it and use
that window position again when you run it again.  The information is
stored in <code>os2.ini</code> but it is very small (probably under
200 bytes).


  <LI> Text Glyphs can now have justification (Left, Center, Right) assigned
to them.  The numbers in the information area are now right-justified
for easier reading.


  <LI> I discovered and fixed several bugs with some of the Glyphs.


  <LI> I discovered and did not fix several bugs with some of the Glyphs.


  <LI> There is a button in the statusbar that lets you cycle through the
different kinds of speed indicators in the game.  This uses one of the
features in the new Glyph system: overlapping glyphs that can be
individually turned on or off.


</UL><P>
<h3> 13 March 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The cursor is now drawn with the new layered graphics system.  It
shouldn't flicker anymore, and there should be fewer display problems.


  <LI> The the old graphics system was eliminated, since only the cursor
code was still using it.


  <LI> For debugging purposes, if SimBlob crashes, it will create a trap
file (<code>simblob.trp</code>) in the current directory.


  <LI> Water sources are placed in a circle around the map, rather than in
random positions.  This ensures that no part of the map is too far
from water.


</UL><P>
<h3> 11 March 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The path-finding algorithm for blobs is improved.  There is now an
absolute limit on the number of hexes that can be searched before a
path is found -- currently it is approximately one-tenth of the map.
If no path is found in that time, the blob will just walk to a point
closer to the goal, and then later it will calculate another path to
the goal.


  <LI> If a blob finds an unexpected obstacle in his way, he will not
recalculate the <EM>entire</EM> but will rather recalculate the first
15 steps of of the path, in hopes that that will get him around the
obstacle.  If it does not, then he will calculate the entire path
again (subject to the restriction above).


</UL><P>
<h3> 5 March 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The information area has been cleaned up a little.


</UL><P>
<h3> 1 March 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) I've cleaned up the Glyph code, which is used to put objects on
the screen.


  <LI> (Internal) Glyphs can now accept mouse clicks.  I will use them in
the future to create buttons to replace the toolbar, which is using
the OS/2 "ValueSet" control at the moment.


  <LI> (Internal) I've added glyph overlaying, where one glyph can go on top
of another glyph.  Buttons will use this, as they are a text or bitmap
glyph on top of a button glyph.


  <LI> When dragging the mouse, I'm using mouse capture mode.  This should
fix some of the bugs with mouse dragging.


</UL><P>
<h3> 31 January 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The flood command has been fixed; it now always causes a flood.


  <LI> Water can flow off the map; as far as water is concerned, there is no
longer an artificial wall around the edges of the map.



</UL><P>
<h3> 26 January 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> I added a scrollbar class to handle the two scrollbars; they've
been made narrower, and they were moved inside the statusbar.


  <LI> The text that goes in the statusbar will be clipped if necessary.


  <LI> Non-immediate drawing (where you draw a line) shows a preview of
what will be drawn.  For example, if you're drawing roads, it will
show the roads that are being drawn.


  <LI> The View options now affect the world map; previously they only
had an effect on the map view.



</UL><P>
<h3> 22 January 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> A bug with scrolling when the "View" menu is pulled down has
been fixed.


  <LI> Scrolling behavior has been improved, both for PM and for DIVE;
most of the changes have to do with scrolling by clicking or
dragging the mouse on the world map.


  <LI> The auto-build mode behavior has improved in some ways, but still
needs a lot more improvement.



</UL><P>
<h3> 19 January 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> A lot of things have been changed to speed up the 
simulation code.  Some of this is due to extensive profiling;
other speedups are due to a change in the way the map is 
scanned for each part of the simulation.


  <LI> Before building a farm, farmers look near a plot of land to see 
if there is a lot of food available in the area.  If there is a
surplus of food, they are less likely to build a
farm. Similarly, people are less likely to build houses if
there are a lot of unemployed people nearby.


  <LI> If there is a shortage of food in an area, a farm is more likely
to be built; if there is a shortage of labor, a house is more 
likely to be built.



</UL><P>
<h3> 13 January 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> I fixed a bug with the new palette system that would cause problems
if the palette manager was not available.


  <LI> Farms now produce food.


  <LI> Food is transported along roads to houses.


  <LI> An excess of food at a house tends to increase the population there;
a shortage of food tends to decrease the population there.


  <LI> The food produced and consumed is displayed in the information area
on the left side.


  <LI> To use DIVE, run <CODE>SIMBLOB DIVE</CODE>.


  <LI> The statusbar now shows more performance information:
<OL>
  <LI> <EM>Ticks per second:</EM>  
       The number of times per second the simulation code runs.
  <LI> <EM>Frames per second:</EM>
       The number of times per second the window is drawn.
  <LI> <EM>MPixels per second:</EM>
       Millions of pixels drawn each second.
</OL>
Please be careful when comparing different drawing techniques
(such as PM vs. DIVE).  To redraw a small part of the window with
DIVE, the entire window must be redrawn.  Non-DIVE drawing can
draw only the area that needs to be drawn.  As a result, when using
DIVE, the MPixels per second number will be higher, because more 
pixels have to be drawn to the window.  However, since many redraws
don't have to draw all the pixels, PM drawing can be faster.  The
frames per second code is a better indicator of drawing speed, but
it is hard to use that as a comparison, because the number will vary
depending on what is being drawn and what part of the map you are
viewing.  For example, if the window is over an empty area of the map,
few pixels need to be drawn so PM gets a high frames per second value.
Also it's hard to tell what is going on with graphics speed because 
SimBlob uses so much CPU time for simulation code.


  <LI> The Speed menu is a little different:
<OL>
  <LI> The speeds associated with Slow, Medium, and Fast are 
       slightly higher.
  <LI> There are two Zoom options.  Zoom Ticks is designed to
       maximize the ticks per second speed -- your world will
       run as fast as possible.  Zoom Frames is designed to
       maximize the frames per second speed -- you will see
       more (small) changes to the map.
</OL>              


  <LI> Periodically, the rivers will flood.  (Inspired by the recent
flooding in the Western U.S.)


  <LI> A new Deity menu option allows you to trigger a flood.



</UL><P>
<h3> 9 January 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> I fixed a major bug with resizing that I introduced with the January
6 version; it was caused by the Blitter objects not knowing when the
window was resized.


  <LI> I've added support for DIVE, as a Blitter object.


  <LI> The map creation messages are now displayed on the statusbar.



</UL><P>
<h3> 6 January 1997 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> I've rewritten the palette system, and it <em>should</em> work
pretty well now on 256-color systems (especially when Netscape
or other palette-stealing application is running).


  <LI> (Internal) I've separated out the code that blits ("draws") to the
screen.  These "Blitter" objects allow me to write the painting 
procedure without referring to any specific kind of blitting.  The
initial two Blitter objects use GpiDrawBits and WinDrawBitmap.


  <LI> (Internal) I've started adding support for DIVE, as a Blitter object.


  <LI> There is a money indicator on the statusbar, and it goes down
when you build certain structures.



</UL><P>
<h3> 30 December 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The water display system has been rewritten to use the new
display system; this should result in faster simulation code
and also faster display code.


  <LI> The fire animations use the new display system instead of
an ugly hack that they used before.  This also fixes a bug
where fire animations would stop unexpectedly.


  <LI> There's now a Options/View menu that lets you control what can
be seen on the main map view.  You can hide various parts of the
map, but not blobs or text (for now).  I'm not sure if this is
of any use.


  <LI> The information area and status bar have a textured background.



</UL><P>
<h3> 28 December 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) The automatic layout system has been extended to work with the
new display system.


  <LI> Fixed a crash that would occur after several window resizes
(including maximize/minimize).


  <LI> The information area on the top left now uses the new display
system; the text in the new display system doesn't yet support
right-justification, so the information area and statusbar
look weird.



</UL><P>
<h3> 27 December 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The statusbar uses the new display system, so you will see
anti-aliased fonts and shadows there.


  <LI> You can now drag the mouse around on the the world map
to move the view to that area.


  <LI> (Internal) A few things were fixed in the automatic layout system.



</UL><P>
<h3> 26 December 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) The font format has changed; instead of Data\Text12.RLE the
file is Data\Font12.RLE.  You can erase the old Text*.* files
now.


  <LI> After a fire burns out, the ground is burnt; you can clear it
out with the erase tool, or you can wait for it to clear on its own.


  <LI> There are new fire bitmaps; I am still looking for better ones.


  <LI> When you jump-scroll from one screen to the next, a small part of
the map remains so that you can orient yourself.  (Previously,
the entire screen changed so that you saw all new hexes.)


  <LI> (Internal) There are a lot of changes to make font handling easier.


  <LI> (Internal) A new layer has been written for text objects so that
text can be easily overlaid on top of the map.



</UL><P>
<h3> 23 December 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) The sprite blit system has been sped up and made
more flexible. (I now perform better clipping checks before 
blitting so that I can
determine whether I should blit everything without clipping, or
blit nothing, or blit with clipping.)    Using C++ templates, I 
have 12 diferent versions of the blit routine, each optimized
by the compiler, instead of having one version with lots of flags
controlling how the blit is performed.



</UL><P>
<h3> 20 December 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> (Internal) So far, the map and blob layers have been implemented 
for the new display system.  (As of Dec 16, only the map layer was 
implemented.)  The layers have been put into separate modules.


  <LI> (Internal) I have designed and partially implemented a new display
system.  Previously, I was using hexagons to determine which parts of
the screen needed to be redrawn.  Each hexagon was marked 'clean' or
'dirty', and all the dirty hexagons were drawn.  The problem with this
approach is that some of the overlays (such as blobs) are not
hexagons; I was handling that by marking the hexagons near and under
the blob as dirty.  Some of you may have seen the bridge drawing
problem, where water would show up through bridges.  This was also an
artifact of the dirty hexagon system.<P>

The new system is structured instead as a set of rectangles
(<code>HRGN</code> for OS/2 programmers).  Also, there are multiple
layers of overlays instead of all the drawing code being in one huge
routine.  The map is drawn at the bottom, then water, then bridges,
then blobs, and finally any textual messages. <P>

The advantages over the old system are:
<OL>
  <LI> Smaller pieces of code are more easily maintained.
  <LI> It should be possible to turn layers on and off
       individually.
  <LI> Oddly shaped items such as bridges can be drawn correctly.
  <LI> Transparency is handled correctly.  Previously, it
       was possible for a transparent bitmap to be drawn twice
       in the same place, so that it showed up opaque.  The
       old solution is to force a much larger redraw
       than necessary, but the new system can handle transparency
       so it won't be necessary to draw so much.
  <LI> I will be able to handle overlay text properly.  (In
       the old system, anything that was larger than a hexagon
	      could not be drawn reliably.)
  <LI> I can place user-interface gadgets on the map as well, 
       like buttons or menus.  Since I can do this, I will
	      change the status area on the left and the status bar on
	      the bottom to use this system as well.
</OL>

The new system also includes:
<OL>
  <LI> "Picking" (which I had implemented as a separate module
       and then lost)
  <LI> Support for non-map layers for user-interface controls
  <LI> Irregularly shaped user-interface controls
</OL>



  <LI> A bug with automatic building was fixed; it led to strange effects
such as building of bridges inside canals.


  <LI> There is now an "About SimBlob" dialog box in the Help menu, which
has been moved over to the right side of the menubar.


  <LI> The "About SimBlob" dialog shows the date of the last compile, and
also the URL for the SimBlob web page.

<UL>
  <LI> The blob builders can sense fires several spaces away and move to
extinguish them.



</UL><P>
<h3> 30 November 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> I am implemented a workaround for systems that do not have a working
GpiDrawBits.  Thanks to Peter Nielsen for the the technique!  To use
the workaround, run <CODE>SIMBLOB ALTBITMAP</CODE>.  It will draw much
slower, but it's better than not drawing at all.



</UL><P>
<h3> 29 November 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The farms now go through many stages, from 'planting' to
'harvesting'.


  <LI> Blob builders now put out fires.  If they see a fire next to them,
they'll move to put it out.  They don't look farther than that,
however.



</UL><P>
<h3> 17 November 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The map now remembers which blob is at each location.
<OL>
  <LI> If another blob attempts to move there, it is blocked.
  <LI> Path-finding code treats nearby blobs as obstacles. I
       assume that if the other blob is nearby, it won't 
       move out of the way in time for this blob to go there.
  <LI> Path-finding code treats all stationary blobs as
       obstacles.  I assume that if the other blob isn't
	      moving, it's more likely that it will stay there than
       move.
</OL>


  <LI> A "B" is shown on the hex where blobs start.


  <LI> If there is a volcano erupting, the world map will display the word,
"Volcano".


  <LI> If a blob is blocked as it is walking, it will wait for a while
before finding a new path around.  This is useful when the blob is
being blocked by something that is likely to move soon.


  <LI> (Temporary) Blob soldiers are drawn as blob builders, and will walk
around not-so-randomly.  (I am using a swarm algorithm; ask if you're
interested in details.)


  <LI> (Temporary) A shadow will fall in front of a blob soldier who is
walking.

<h3> 4 November 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> If you use the Shift key while drawing, it will reverse the sense of
the line-drawing mode.  Roads, Walls, Canals, and Bridges are normally
drawn as lines; Fires, Trees, Eraser, and Gates use freehand drawing
mode.  If you use Shift, it will use the other mode.


  <LI> If you use the Ctrl key while drawing, it will use the Eraser tool
instead of the tool you have selected.  Ctrl can be combined with the
Shift key to erase in straight lines.



</UL><P>
<h3> 1 November 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The water graphics are slightly different; I've changed the way water
is drawn in order to improve the bridge redrawing.


  <LI> Auto-build mode is more likely to build straight bridges.


  <LI> When walls and canals are drawn next to each other, the graphics are
merged.


  <LI> The world map has a small box showing what area is being displayed in
the main view.


  <LI> You can left-click on the world map to move the view to that
location.  There are still some bugs in the redisplay.


  <LI> Terrain generation includes some volcanic activity.



</UL><P>
<h3> 26 October 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Springs now have an "S" on them.


  <LI> There are now bridges!  Unfortunately, I still haven't figured out
how I want to handle bridges.  Right now, they won't display properly,
and you can build any shaped bridge anywhere.  (It doesn't have to be
straight, and it doesn't have to be over anything.)


  <LI> There are more options in the Erase submenu, to erase only certain
kinds of things from the map.


  <LI> If the blobs want to build a road somewhere, but there is a house or
farm there, the blobs owning the house or farm might vacate.


  <LI> (Internal) Some more possibilities of thread deadlocks were removed.


  <LI> The colors on the world map more closely match those on the
main view.

<h3> 22 October 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The wall graphics are now textured gray rather than flat gray with a
pink border.


  <LI> The buttons on the left side of the window are replaced by population
and job information.  The numbers in parentheses are the percentage of
people working and the percentage of jobs that are filled.


  <LI> The cursor flickers much less now.


  <LI> There are now more sources of water than before, and they can be
anywhere on the map, rather than only one per quadrant.


  <LI> During map creation, the world is flooded.  This is an attempt to
create erosion channels.



</UL><P>
<h3> 18 October 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Towers are now Gates.  They allow a small amount of water to flow
through.  With gates, you can build a dam that has water flowing
through the front.  I find that three gates allows enough water to
flow to produce a decent river.


  <LI> The world map updates more often if there is a volcano on the map.
This slows down the game as well.



</UL><P>
<h3> 16 October 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> Water flow rules and erosion has been changed yet again; this time,
I'm happier with the resulting world after 500,000 ticks, but I'm
still unable to get the rivers to stabilize.  On the other hand,
perhaps it is better that the rivers change course often -- players
will have to control the rivers with canals and walls.


  <LI> I have reimplemented automatic window layout (see the what's new
entry for July 28 for details).  I have not yet made the scrollbars
use this.


  <LI> In preparation for various information being displayed on the left
side of the window, I have added a static control.  Currently it shows
"SimBlob", but eventually it will have information such as money,
population, and employment.


  <LI> The button for "erase" has been changed to match Warp 4's close
button.  The button for roads has been recolored so that it matches
the road color on the map.

  <LI> There are now thirteen months with twenty-eight days in each.  The
thirteenth month is the Holy Month, when the blobs hold religious
ceremonies.


  <LI> Fires are animated.


  <LI> Water flow rules and erosion have been changed again.  I'm still
searching for something that will give rivers rather than lakes.


  <LI> Terrain generation now includes volcanic eruptions.

<h3> 27 September 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The seasons menu has been removed.  Seasons now change
automatically.


  <LI> A major bug with window resizing has been fixed (again).


  <LI> The scrolling has been improved.  For all the programmers out
there, here are the details:
<OL>
  <LI> WinScrollWindow gives you a dirty rectangle that should
       be redrawn.  I was using this rectangle to draw my
       internal buffer, and then blit it to the screen.
	      Instead, I now use it only to blit to the screen, and I
	      determine what needs to be drawn to the buffer by
	      looking at what would be uncovered by the scroll
	      operation.  (One edge of the window needs to be
	      redrawn.)
  <LI> I moved the WinScrollWindow operation to the very
  	      <I>end</I> of the paint routine.  This minimizes the time
	      after the scroll but before the painting of the exposed
	      area.  Scrolling feels much smoother now because you
	      don't notice the redrawing of the exposed area.

  <LI> Minor bugs with mouse dragging were introduced.


  <LI> There are two independently scrolling View windows.


  <LI> The terrain bitmaps have been fixed.


  <LI> You can drag from one window to another to draw "across the
map".


  <LI> The tree graphics have been changed, and young trees
are drawn smaller than full grown trees.


  <LI> (Internal) Changes to the internals:
     <UL>
 <li> The main window is laid out "automatically" using
      Layout algorithms.  The layout objects can set up
      components Horizontally or Vertically, and a component
      can be another Layout, a fixed space, a variable space,
      or a window (or control). <P> Now I don't have to 
      compute the coordinates of each of the controls, so
      it's very easy to add new ones.
 <li> The scrollbars are now part of the main window instead
      of part of the frame window.  OS/2's frame window has
      flags to create two scrollbars, but I wanted four, and
      I also wanted to control their size and placement.
 <li> The statusbar uses the "Subject-Observer" design
      pattern [also called Model-View-Controller] instead
      of the more traditional object interface.  <P>

      This is very helpful because various parts of the
      program only have to know about Subjects -- they don't
      have to be aware of where the subject data will be
      displayed (a statusbar), so I can move the display to
      another control (like a static text control or titlebar)
      without requiring any changes in all the clients.  Also,
      since StatusBar relies on PM, this will allow me to write
      modules are <B>not</B> dependent on PM in any way.
 <li> I'm going to make the scrollbars use Subject-Observer
      so that the view window, the keyboard interface, and
      the scrollbar all look at a common (consistent) map
      position, instead of all three trying to update each
	     other to maintain consistency manually.  Subject-Observer
      requires less code and is more flexible than the
	     traditional object interfaces.  I should write a web
      page about SimBlob's internals sometime, but things
      are changing so fast right now that I think I will wait
	     until the internals stabilize.

<B> Note: </B> These changes were lost in a hard disk crash. <P>


<UL>
  <LI> The Speed menu now includes options for using DIVE.  Temporarily,
DIVE is required, even if you have it set to 0%.  Testers have
reported that 50% DIVE works well, and 100% DIVE slows down
scrolling too much.


  <LI> The right mouse button now controls Picking instead of soldiers.
It reports what is under the spot at which you clicked, but it

<UL>
  <LI> The terrain drawing behavior has been rewritten.  Internally, 
each terrain type on the toolbar is associated with a Tool object
that controls the appearance and behavior of the tool.  This will
make it easier to add new types of tools that do <I>not</I> draw
terrain to the map.


  <LI> The mouse drag behavior (when drawing certain types of terrain)

it lets me use my own bitmap formats, and also opens up a
path to DIVE.


  <LI> The blob soldiers are now drawn with blob bitmaps instead of
little rectangles.


  <LI> There is now a nicer startup screen.


  <LI> There is a little blob on the bottom left of the main window.


  <LI> The pushbuttons are now "Volcano" and "Rain".


  <LI> Volcanos produce lava, which raises the terrain (when it hardens).


  <LI> A "terrain equalizer" has been added to keep a good distribution
of altitudes.  If there are too many high altitudes, it lowers
some of them; if there are too many low altitudes, it raises
some of them.  This keeps the map from being too boring -- either
too high, too low, or too flat. 

To try this out, start up several
volcanos to fill in all the green areas.  Set the speed to Zoom
and watch the brown slowly turn green.

<h3> 1 June 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The terrain mode toolbox has been moved inside the main window.
To do this, I rewrote the class lirary I was using for PM
windows.  I'm also testing this new class library by adding
pushbuttons inside the main window.


  <LI> Two pushbuttons allow you to increase and decrease the amount
of water that flows from the springs.


  <LI> You can now place "canals", which look like inverted towers.
They are the opposite of walls -- they are dug 40 feet deep,
and can be used to channel away floodwater or to divert rivers.
Since the bottom of a canal is concrete, there is no erosion.


  <LI> When the window is not active, the paint thread gets idle
priority, which speeds up the game and other applications.



</UL><P>
<h3> 30 May 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The farm and cursor colors have been changed again.


  <LI> I'm trying out better water graphics.  They show the depth of
the water as well as the average depth between two hexagons;
the result is that lakes and rivers look smoother.  (There are
also 64 levels of water now, instead of 6.)


  <LI> (Internal) A lot of internals have changed.  Soon I hope to have support for
multiple views.


  <LI> The dragging graphic has been changed from a partial outline to
a shaded hexagon.



</UL><P>
<h3> 26 May 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The house colors have been changed to dark gray for empty and cyan
for full.


  <LI> The farm graphics are different, once again.  (But not better!)


  <LI> Trees are more likely to grow near rivers.


  <LI> I'm trying out some experimental water graphics.


  <LI> You can now draw roads and walls by dragging a line from one place
to another.


  <LI> Wall graphics are slightly better.



</UL><P>
<h3> 20 May 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The house graphics are better.


  <LI> The farm graphics are different, not necessarily better.


  <LI> I've started to work on the economic simulation.  Houses provide
labor, and farms provide jobs.  There's just a question of how to
link labor up to jobs.  Right now, they try to move along roads
to find work.


  <LI> The status bar shows statistics about the job market.


  <LI> Houses will empty out if the residents can't find jobs.


  <LI> I'm really starting to consider using DIVE for this game ...



</UL><P>
<h3> 10 May 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The tree and tower graphics are better.


  <LI> Trees die out after some time.  Trees on mountains are more likely
to die early than trees in lowlands.


  <LI> Farmers prefer areas near a source of water.


  <LI> The scrolling speed has been improved a little.


  <LI> The Speed menu has checkmarks to show what speed is set.


  <LI> The status bar shows ticks/second.  (A tick is a unit of time
for the simulation.)  I get between 8 and 10 ticks/sec in Zoom
mode on my 486/66.  I hope to improve that speed a little.  :)


  <LI> The thread priorities have been adjusted.  During startup, the
system should be more responsive while the map is being generated.
The painting has been assigned a higher priority thread so
that it can respond quickly.



</UL><P>
<h3> 5 May 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The toolbar is outside the main window so that it doesn't block your
view.


  <LI> I rewrote the scrolling system, so that it's much faster!


  <LI> Erosion works better now.  In addition to low terrain eroding fast,
soil with lots of moisture will erode faster.  (Areas near a river
or lake erode quickly.)


  <LI> It's now harder to build a wall underwater.


  <LI> The water-flow algorithm is new -- it allows rivers to be wider than
one hex wide.



</UL><P>
<h3> 21 April 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The toolbar is cleaner so that it's easier to see which tool is chosen.


  <LI> Forests grow when trees spread seeds around.  Plant a tree and watch
a forest grow from it.


  <LI> Houses are now like farms -- they will spring up around roads.


  <LI> If houses are underwater too long, they will eventually be destroyed.
(Previously, blobs would move out but the houses would remain.)


  <LI> Fires can burn trees, houses, farms, and roads.


  <LI> There is a new option on the Special menu to erase only soldiers.


  <LI> The terrain graphics have been updated to look better.


  <LI> Rivers pick up sediment upstream and deposit it downstream.  This
leads to interesting behavior that is matched in nature.  If you
start out with a straight river on mostly-level terrain, the sediment
will build up and cause the river to "meander".  Some of the variables
still need to be adjusted a bit; the buildup on the banks can be a bit
too much at times.


  <LI> Erosion behavior is different -- low terrain erodes heavily now.


  <LI> The scrollbar behavior is erratic.  I'm still trying to get scrolling
to work properly in the new screen painting routines.  I'm considering
using DIVE, which would solve all my painting problems.  <code>:)</code>



</UL><P>
<h3> 13 April 1996 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> There is a toolbar on the bottom left that lets you choose type
type of terrain to draw.  This interface will change
eventually, but this one is really easy to program, so I
decided to put it in until there's something better.


  <LI> There are now lots of blob soldiers.  Every time you
right-click somewhere, a new soldier is created to walk there.
There is no way to make that soldier do anything else (for
now).  You can do fun things this way -- pick an area of the
map and start right clicking everywhere, and an entire army
will be created to walk to that area.


  <LI> There is a new menu with some neat effects: Rain, Army, and
Erase.  Rain creates lots of water all over the map.  Army
creates a hundred soldiers to go to random places on the map.
Erase erases all soldiers and structures.  <b>WARNING</b>: Do
not use Erase while soldiers are moving, or there may be a crash.


  <LI> The different levels of path approximations let me experiment
with tradeoffs in the <a href="../gameprog.html">A*
algorithm</a> for finding shortest-paths.  Best finds really
good paths; Fast finds paths quickly but they're not very
accurate.  In particular, Fast tends to ignore roads.  It also
does really badly if there are obstacles -- I'm still trying to
debug this.


  <LI> There are a lot of redraw problems.  I restructured the
program's paint loop to speed things up, but scrolling doesn't
work very well yet.  Also, when the blobs move around, they
sometimes leave garbage behind.


  <LI> Lots of path-search statistics are printed at the bottom after
you assign a destination to a blob soldier.  You can ignore
these if you want.  :) Steps tells you the number of hexes the
blob will step through.  Scan tells you how many hexes the A*
algorithm searched to find the path.  Cost tells you the amount
of time it takes to walk that distance.  The algorithm is
currently set up to find the least cost path.  You can compare
the path cost to the approximation level -- Best gives you the
least cost and Fast gives you the highest.  



</UL><P>
<h3> 8 March 1996 </h3>

(It's been a long time!)


<UL>
  <LI> The blob soldier causes fewer redraw problems as he moves.


  <LI> There are more terrain levels, giving more information about altitude.


  <LI> Roads now offer double the normal movement rate for blob soldiers.


  <LI> A bug with the soldier bouncing off a wall repeatedly when the
wall spot was his goal .. was fixed.  Now he will stop if the
goal cannot be reached.


  <LI> I added some more erosion back into the game.  High altitudes
erode less than middle altitudes.  Low altitudes have medium
erosion.  



</UL><P>
<h3> 16 December 1995 </h3>

(I was on vacation from December 17 to January 9.)


<UL>
  <LI> Scrolling is much faster, but it doesn't always look right.  I
think this is because another thread is drawing while I'm scrolling;
I need to fix this someday. :)


  <LI> I've disabled erosion because I get much more interesting terrain
without it.


  <LI> There is now a blob that can move around on the map!  Use the right
mouse button to select a target for the blob.  He will try to avoid
moving uphill when possible and he can't travel through walls.  If
the path he selects later has a wall on it, he will recompute a new
path.  (Eventually, the blob will continuously update its path 
depending on new terrain conditions; this will be a background
thread.)


  <LI> I think the last of the purple-splotch bugs has been fixed.  There
was a problem in 16-bit modes because SimBlob assumed that purple
(255,0,255) existed in the palette, but in 16-bit mode, it doesn't.




</UL><P>
<h3> 21 November 1995 </h3>

(School is still keeping me busy!)


<UL>
  <LI> I think water is flowing pretty well now.  There are still some
places it needs to be improved -- for example, sometimes it's 
wider than I would expect, and there are still gaps in the flow.


  <LI> Transparent bitmaps <bold>should</bold> work now, on all video
drivers!  This has taken a long time to get working properly,
because the `easy' way (marking one color `transparent') does
not work on all drivers, and the `hard' way (making a separate
mask bitmap) needed to be done automatically.  I am generating
all the roads, walls, and houses instead of drawing them by hand,
so I had to make all the routines produce a separate mask and
image instead of a bitmap with a transparent color.


  <LI> The File menu was split up into the File and Speed menus.


  <LI> A new menu was added that will eventually let you pick which terrain
to draw.  It currently does nothing.


  <LI> A new `trees' tile has been added, but it doesn't do anything
yet.  I will probably turn this into several levels of forest
(light, medium, dense) later.


  <LI> All the bitmaps are now in the executable, instead of being
generated at the beginning of the game.  This greatly reduces
startup time!


  <LI> The huge executable size reflects the size of the added bitmaps.
Right now, they're all stored in 24-bit format, but I will soon
convert them to 8-bit to save space.


  <LI> Erosion is disabled.  I needed to do this to get the rivers to
work properly.  I want to add erosion back in, but I have not
yet determined how I should do this.



</UL><P>
<h3> 5 November 1995 </h3>

(School has kept me busy, so I haven't worked on SimBlob a lot.)


<UL>
  <LI> A statusbar has been added, but it doesn't show anything right now.
You <em>can</em> do some fun things to it, like drag FG/BG colors
or fonts to it.


  <LI> I spent a lot of time on getting water to flow properly, but it
doesn't want to cooperate.  I might just give up on this, and use
a static water model, like SimCity and Civilization.  :(


  <LI> Towers are like walls in the current simulation, but once military
units are added, they will be able to use towers for better defense
than walls provide.


  <LI> A minor bug in house display was fixed -- the seventh house would
not get highlighted.  (I was using a less-than test instead of a
less-than-or-equal-to test!)


  <LI> The terrain is randomly generated now.  I've been experimenting with
various terrain generation algorithms.


  <LI> The File menu has several options for changing the speed of the
simulation.  (Yes, I know, I know -- this should be in a Speed menu!)


  <LI> (Internal) I've taken some steps towards making "multiple views" possible.
Once multiple views are possible, you will be able to open several
map windows and view different parts of the map at the same time.
They will all stay synchronized.


  <LI> The transparent bitmap display <em>still</em> does not work for most 
users.  This is mainly because I haven't worked on it yet -- I do
have several options in mind, but I haven't decided which method to
use.  I don't want to choose one method and then later decide to use
another, so I'm considering my options carefully.


  <LI> If you resize the window large enough, the scrollbars <em>should</em>
disappear.  This is flaky right now -- sometimes they don't disappear,
and sometimes they disappear and won't come back.



</UL><P>
<h3> 20 August 1995 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The game is faster and some redraw bugs have been fixed.


  <LI> You can now build residential areas.  Up to 7 homes can be
in each hex.  People will move in automatically, and the
gray (empty) homes will turn into red (full) ones.


  <LI> (Internal) Some of the redrawing code has been rewritten.  If you see any
redraw problems, please let me know!  Bright purple is my error
color -- if you see it, you know there's a problem.


  <LI> The map initialization is done in a separate thread instead of
in the main one.  The window will come up faster now, but it
still takes a while before the map appears.



</UL><P>
<h3> 7 August 1995 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The game is much faster!  I restructured the redrawing code, and
it got much faster, but it still needs some redraw bugs fixed.



</UL><P>
<h3> 5 August 1995 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> <A NAME="layered"><strong>Layered Terrain</strong></A>: 
There are three levels of tiles
instead of just one.  The bottom layer is the altitude indicator:<br>
<IMG SRC="hex2grass.gif" ALT="[wet grass]">
<IMG SRC="hex1grass.gif" ALT="[dry grass]">
<IMG SRC="hexdirt.gif" ALT="[clear area]">
<IMG SRC="hex1hill.gif" ALT="[low hill]">
<IMG SRC="hex2hill.gif" ALT="[high hill]">
<IMG SRC="hex1mountain.gif" ALT="[low mountain]">
<IMG SRC="hex2mountain.gif" ALT="[high mountain]">
<br>
The middle layer has structures:<br>
<IMG SRC="hexfarm.gif" ALT="">farm,
<IMG SRC="hexroad.gif" ALT="">road, and
<IMG SRC="hexwall.gif" ALT="">wall.
<br>
The top layer has water:<br>
<IMG SRC="hexwater.gif" ALT="[water]">
<br>
The main effect of this is that you can now have multiple things
on a single tile.  Previously, if there was a wall, the grass
would not be displayed, and only a wall on a gray tile.  Now the
wall is shown on top of grass.  If there is water, you can partially
see what's underneath.


  <LI> Farms will automatically spring up around roads.


  <LI> Farms are destroyed by water.  (They're not Rice Farms.)


  <LI> Roads and Walls can be destroyed if covered by water too long.



</UL><P>
<h3> 3 August 1995 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The terrain now has a hill on the left and a valley on the right.


  <LI> Erosion does seem to work, but I'm not sure if it's realistic.
There are ways to manipulate it.  :)


  <LI> There are now different colored tiles for different altitudes:
green is low; brown is medium; gray is high.



</UL><P>
<h3> 2 August 1995 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> The terrain is now a bowl-shape instead of an inclined plane.  This
causes the water to flow into the middle.


  <LI> Simple erosion is implemented.  Sediments will flow along with the
water.  To see the effect of this, just start the program and let
it run for a while.  The lake starts to fill up with dirt, and it
gets wider.  Or is the effect of having more water?  :)  I don't know!
Another way to see this is to force the river into some path, and
later take away the walls.  Some of the time you will see that the
river has eroded away a path for itself and it will not return to
its original path.


  <LI> Walls are 100 inches high instead of 1000 inches.  This makes overflows
much more likely.



</UL><P>
<h3> 29 July 1995 </h3>


<UL>
  <LI> There are now scrollbars that seem to work.  The display is
a little bit slow; I am working on speeding this up.
(Note:  The pageup/pagedown and lineup/linedown parts don't
 work yet, but you should be able to drag the scrollbutton
 around.)


  <LI> The game is running a little slower than it should because
the entire map is drawn instead of just the part that's visible.


  <LI> The menu has a "Color Edit" option that brings up a color palette.
You can drag a color from the palette to the game to change the
color of the standard controls (titlebar (active & inactive), 
menu, system menu, scrollbar, and frame (active & inactive)).


  <LI> Use the left mouse button to toggle the terrain in one direction
and the right mouse button to go in the other direction.  This won't
be there for long, because the right button will be used to bring up
a context-sensitive menu for the object(s) under the mouse.  The most
likely interface will be the user selecting a tool (road, wall, farm,
etc.) and then selecting areas to build the item.


  <LI> The window can be resized and things <em>should</em> look right.
